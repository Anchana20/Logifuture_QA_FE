QUESTION - How would you have tackled this challenge if, instead of a website it would have asked you to test a native application?

ANSWER
* Currently Cypress is not supported the Native application automation.
* Cypress supports mob-web application, that we have already achieved in this project.
* If we want to verify few things from native/mobile application, i'll achieve this using API to check the data and few validations for particular module.
* if we want to do completely, We have familiar tool in the market for mobile automation called APPIUM, i will go with this tool.
